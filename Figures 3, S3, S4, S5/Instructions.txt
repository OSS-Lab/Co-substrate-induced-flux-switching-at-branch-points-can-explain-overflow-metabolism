Figure 3 - To make the figure as it appears in the paper simply run the Figure_3.py file in plotdata. If you want to look at more parameters, you need to make the data and heatmaps first. These files are in the runsims folder. I suggest that you make copies of the make_data_Figure_3.py and make_heatmaps_Figure_3.py files, and change the parameters there, then make a copy of Figure_3.py and change the parameters there also. make_data_Figure_3.py needs to be run before make_heatmaps_Figure_3.py. Note also that by default make_data will skip any data already generated, so for a "clean" run I suggest deleting the data in data/megadata. Making the data for each heatmap takes around 5-10 minutes on a 32 thread cpu (using 26 threads)

Figure S3 - Simply run the Figure_S3.py file in plotdata. The KeqB, Btot, VmaxB, CKcat_top and CKcat_bottom values can be changed in lines 55-65. Note that panels A/B use Btot_vals and VMB_vals, while C/D use Btot_vals2 and VMB_vals2.

Figure S4 -  To make the figure as it appears in the paper simply run the Figure_S4.py file in plotdata. If you want to look at more parameters for the heatmap, you need to make the data and heatmaps first. These files are in the runsims folder. I suggest that you make copies of the make_data_Figure_S4.py and make_heatmaps_Figure_S4.py files, and change the parameters there, then make a copy of Figure_S4.py and change the parameters there also. make_data_Figure_S4.py needs to be run before make_heatmaps_Figure_S4.py. Note also that by default make_data will skip any data already generated, so for a "clean" run I suggest deleting the data in data/megadata. Making the data for each heatmap takes around 5-10 minutes on a 32 thread cpu (using 26 threads). For the line plot, the parameters Btot, VMB, KeqB and rev can be changed on lines 265-268.

Figure S5 - To make the figure as it appears in the paper simply run the Figure_S5.py file in plotdata. If you want to look at more parameters for the heatmap, you need to make the data and heatmaps first. These files are in the runsims folder. I suggest that you make copies of the make_data_Figure_S5.py and make_heatmaps_Figure_S5.py files, and change the parameters there, then make a copy of Figure_S5.py and change the parameters there also. make_data_Figure_S5.py needs to be run before make_heatmaps_Figure_S5.py. Note also that by default make_data will skip any data already generated, so for a "clean" run I suggest deleting the data in data/megadata. Making the data for each heatmap takes around 5-10 minutes on a 32 thread cpu (using 26 threads). For the line plots, the parameters Btot, VMB can be changed for each row on lines 68-82. The other parameters should match those that you use for the heatmaps, and can be changed on lines 38-46 and 128-152.
