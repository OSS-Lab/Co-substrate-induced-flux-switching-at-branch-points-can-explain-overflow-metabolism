Figure 2 - just run the Figure_2.py file. The Ks_top, Ks_bottom, V24, Btot, VMB, KeqB and rev values can be changed at the top of the file to see the effects. Note that the dashed lines have Ks_top=Ks_bottom hard coded.

Figure S8 - just run the Figure_S8.py file. The V24, al, Btot, VMB, KeqB and rev values can be changed at the top of the file to see the effects. Note that the dashed lines have al=[1.,1.,1.,1.] hardcoded.

Parameters:
	Ks_top/Ks_bottom - michaelis menten constants for the M2->M3 / M2->M4 reactions.
	V24 - Vmax for the M2->M4 reaction.
	Btot - total amount of co-substrate (B0+B1).
	VMB - Vmax for the background co-substrate reaction.
	KeqB - Keq for the background co-substrate reaction.
	al - allosteric coeffecients for the branch point reactions [M2->M3, cosub for M2->M3 (no effect if there is no cosubstrate on this reaction), M2->M4, cosub for M2->M4 (no effect if there is no cosubstrate on this reaction)].
