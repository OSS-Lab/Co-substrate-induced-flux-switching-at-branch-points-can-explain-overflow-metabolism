Figure S1 - To make the figure as it appears in the paper simply run the Figure_S1.py file in plotdata. If you want to look at more parameters, you need to make the data and heatmaps first. These files are in the runsims folder. I suggest that you make copies of the make_data_Figure_S1.py and make_heatmaps_Figure_S1.py files, and change the parameters there, then make a copy of Figure_S1.py and change the parameters there also. make_data_Figure_S1.py needs to be run before make_heatmaps_Figure_S1.py. Note also that by default make_data will skip any data already generated, so for a "clean" run I suggest deleting the data in data/megadata. Making the data for each heatmap takes around 5-10 minutes on a 32 thread cpu (using 26 threads)
