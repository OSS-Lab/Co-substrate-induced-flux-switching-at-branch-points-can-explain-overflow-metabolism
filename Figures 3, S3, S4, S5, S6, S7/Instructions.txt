Note that for these figures, only the relevant heatmap data is included, not the individual results. This is due to the amount of data generated. The figures will still be generated properly. but the "make_heatmaps" scripts will not work without the relevant "make_data" scripts being run first.


Figure 3 - To make the figure as it appears in the paper simply run the Figure_3.py file in plotdata. If you want to look at more parameters, you need to make the data and heatmaps first. These files are in the runsims folder. I suggest that you make copies of the make_data_Figure_3.py and make_heatmaps_Figure_3.py files, and change the parameters there, then make a copy of Figure_3.py and change the parameters there also. make_data_Figure_3.py needs to be run before make_heatmaps_Figure_3.py. Note also that by default make_data will skip any data already generated, so for a "clean" run I suggest deleting the data in data/megadata. Making the data for each heatmap takes around 5-10 minutes on a 32 thread cpu (using 26 threads)

Figure S3 - Run the file in the plotdata folder.

Figure S4 - To make the figure as it appears in the paper simply run the Figure_S4.py file in plotdata. If you want to look at more parameters, you need to make the data and heatmaps first. These files are in the runsims folder. I suggest that you make copies of the make_data_Figure_S4.py and make_heatmaps_Figure_S4.py files, and change the parameters there, then make a copy of Figure_S4.py and change the parameters there also. make_data_Figure_S4.py needs to be run before make_heatmaps_Figure_S4.py. Note also that by default make_data will skip any data already generated, so for a "clean" run I suggest deleting the data in data/megadata. Making the data for each heatmap takes around 5-10 minutes on a 32 thread cpu (using 26 threads)

Figure S5 - Simply run the Figure_S5.py file in plotdata. The KeqB, Btot, VmaxB, CKcat_top and CKcat_bottom values can be changed in lines 55-65. Note that panels A/B use Btot_vals and VMB_vals, while C/D use Btot_vals2 and VMB_vals2.

Figure S6 -  To make the figure as it appears in the paper simply run the Figure_S6.py file in plotdata. If you want to look at more parameters for the heatmap, you need to make the data and heatmaps first. These files are in the runsims folder. I suggest that you make copies of the make_data_Figure_S6.py and make_heatmaps_Figure_S6.py files, and change the parameters there, then make a copy of Figure_S6.py and change the parameters there also. make_data_Figure_S6.py needs to be run before make_heatmaps_Figure_S6.py. Note also that by default make_data will skip any data already generated, so for a "clean" run I suggest deleting the data in data/megadata. Making the data for each heatmap takes around 5-10 minutes on a 32 thread cpu (using 26 threads). For the line plot, the parameters Btot, VMB, KeqB and rev can be changed on lines 265-268.

Note that the script that makes the data does so for all 16 og the motifs shown, so can take a while.

Figure S7 - To make the figure as it appears in the paper simply run the Figure_S7.py file in plotdata. If you want to look at more parameters for the heatmap, you need to make the data and heatmaps first. These files are in the runsims folder. I suggest that you make copies of the make_data_Figure_S7.py and make_heatmaps_Figure_S7.py files, and change the parameters there, then make a copy of Figure_S7.py and change the parameters there also. make_data_Figure_S7.py needs to be run before make_heatmaps_Figure_S7.py. Note also that by default make_data will skip any data already generated, so for a "clean" run I suggest deleting the data in data/megadata. Making the data for each heatmap takes around 5-10 minutes on a 32 thread cpu (using 26 threads). For the line plots, the parameters Btot, VMB can be changed for each row on lines 68-82. The other parameters should match those that you use for the heatmaps, and can be changed on lines 38-46 and 128-152.
